# WebGL Shader Animation

This repository contains a WebGL project that demonstrates shader animation using WebGL (Web Graphics Library). The animation is rendered on a full-screen canvas and is powered by custom vertex and fragment shaders.

## Features

- **Dynamic Animation**: Utilizes WebGL to create real-time animated graphics directly in the browser.
- **Shader Programming**: Custom fragment and vertex shaders (`fs` and `vs` respectively) define the visual effects and animation behavior.
- **Responsive Canvas**: The WebGL canvas dynamically adjusts to fill the entire browser window, ensuring a responsive and immersive viewing experience.
- **Interactive Elements**: Demonstrates shader interactivity with mouse input and time-based animation.
- **Shader Functions**: Includes functions for noise generation (`noise`) and 2D rotation (`rotate2d`) to manipulate shader visuals.

## Technologies Used

- **WebGL**: A JavaScript API for rendering interactive 3D and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser.
- **HTML/CSS**: Standard web technologies used to structure and style the page and canvas.
- **JavaScript**: Provides the logic to initialize WebGL, manage shaders, and handle animation updates.
- **Shader Language**: GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) used for creating custom shaders that define the visual output.

## Usage

To view and interact with the animation:
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a WebGL-capable web browser.
3. Explore the animated shader effects rendered in real-time.
4. Resize the browser window to see the responsive canvas in action.


Feel free to explore, modify, and use this project to learn more about WebGL, shader programming, and real-time graphics on the web.
